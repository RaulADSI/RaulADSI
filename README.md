### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rulo, a software developer passionate about exploring and building applications. While Iâ€™m still learning technologies like Java, Spring Boot, and REST APIs, Iâ€™m eager to grow and take on new challenges. I believe learning is a journey, and Iâ€™m excited about every step of it! When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy diving into new hobbies and sipping on a great cup of coffee â˜•.
Let's connect, collaborate, and share ideas! ðŸ™Œ
